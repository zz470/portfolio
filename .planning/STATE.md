# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- TypeScript data file over MDX (content is structured fields, TS gives type safety with zero tooling)
- Local images in public/ over CDN (never depend on external service for core assets again)
- Direct imports over API layer (no need for fetch/hooks pattern when data is local and static)
- [Phase 02]: Copied lib/data/projects.ts and consumer rewiring from main repo to resolve parallel worktree isolation — Plan 01 changes were not present in this worktree

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Supabase Storage (S3) files are not recoverable — placeholder images will be used until user re-downloads originals. This is expected and accepted.
